### This is a repo for basic ImageNet1K running validation eval. Additionally, also to train a classifier on top of frozen ImageNet1k features on downstream datasets - CIFAR100.

#### Effect of BatchSize and not putting BatchNorm Layers to .eval() when validating or testing the model.

#### Effect of linear probing on CIFAR100 and not putting BatchNorm Layers to .eval() when validating or testing the model.

![CIFAR Buggy](readme_images/cifar100_buggy.png)

CIFAR100, just training the classifier grid search on `LR (0.1 to 0.00001) with BS 128, and SGD`. **Best: 61.85% Top 1 Accuracy**. (which is quite a lot higher than what we see 54.51 when using https://github.com/linusericsson/ssl-transfer)

**Note**: this is buggy with params.requires_grad=False but BN is in .train() mode.

![CIFAR Fixed](readme_images/cifar100_fixed.png)

**Best test accuracy: 71.20% at Epoch 10, for Learning Rate = 0.01000**. Makes a hell of a lot of difference!!! Almost 10 p.p., which is non-trivial at the very least.

 
**Note**: *cifar100_train_eval_linear_classifier_gridsearch_buggy.py* is buggy with `params.requires_grad=False` but `BN` is in `.train()` mode when the `model.train()` step takes place. *cifar100_train_eval_linear_classifier_gridsearch.py* is the fixed file.
